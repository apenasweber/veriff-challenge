# VERIFF CHALLENGE
Hello guys! Thanks for opportunity, i am very happy with the idea that we could work together soon.

Before you take the code, i have some considerations here:
1. Actually i am working a lot in new projects for Avenue Code/MZ GROUP, my actual job, including WEEKENDS with studies and new deadline challenges, so i take your challenge in the weekend, using every free second that i had focus on MUST TO HAVE actions to send you this on monday and i think we have a good code here! It was a good challenge, thank you!
2. I started using the best practices of OOP and SOLID principles thinking about scalability, maintenability and clean code. 
3. The tests are simple, but with 83% coverage, with all locally mocked(you can do this in a local machine without internet connection) but off course we can improve the tests in number and complexity.
4. About performance, using OOP and SOLID increases 30% in the total time spent between original app and actual app. You can check the original app performance here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fpC61Wf7qUD1m-35TnQ09WcGRadXkt1Z?usp=sharing
5. I used logging info to put logs inside birdclassifier.log(started with init() of ImageClassifier).
6. Tensorflow warnings about gpu/cuda and saver can be solved so this will be a good future improvement.
7. Docker will be a good improvement but this is a NICE-TO-HAVE in tasks description(bonus) so i focused on do my best with time i have for now and i think we have a good delivery here, can you send some feedbacks about it? thanks!

## Local setup

2) Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) Run the code `python classifier.py`
